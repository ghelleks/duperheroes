## **Project: "Hero Battle" (Working Title)**

**Version: 2.0**

### **1. Introduction & Vision**

#### **1.1. Project Overview**

This document outlines the requirements for a superhero identification web application. The system consists of two main components: a public game website where players can compete in single-user and multiplayer superhero identification challenges, and a password-protected admin site for managing the superhero database. The core experience includes single-user time-based challenges (Beat the Clock, Speedrun, Practice) and optional multiplayer battles between two players. Players earn in-game currency through victories and use that currency to purchase cosmetic customizations.

#### **1.2. Vision Statement**

To create a fun, educational, and competitive web-based game featuring original satirical animal-themed superheroes. The public website provides immediate access to single-user superhero challenges while offering optional multiplayer battles for those seeking social competition. Players can test their knowledge of these humorous animal parodies at their own pace or in competitive formats, earning rewards and achieving the title of ultimate "animal hero expert." The admin site ensures easy content management and database maintenance for this unique character universe.

### **2. User Personas**

* **The Casual Gamer:** Enjoys quick, competitive mobile games. Prefers immediate access without setup barriers. May not be familiar with traditional superheroes but finds the animal parodies amusing and accessible.
* **The Comedy Enthusiast:** Appreciates satirical and humorous content. Values the creative animal-themed parodies and is motivated by discovering clever references and wordplay.
* **The Social Competitor:** Plays games to connect with friends. Is motivated by leaderboards, challenging friends directly, and sharing their victories in multiplayer battles featuring these unique characters.
* **The Solo Learner:** Wants to learn about the animal hero universe at their own pace. Prefers practice modes without time pressure and values the humorous facts and origin stories.
* **The Time-Challenged Player:** Has limited gaming time and wants quick, accessible gameplay. Values single-user modes that can be played anytime without waiting for other players or managing social features.

* **Authentication Required:** Multiplayer features require user registration for identity verification and social features.

#### **3.4. Multiplayer Gameplay Loop: "The Battle"**

* A battle consists of two players competing in a series of rounds.
* **Round Start:** A high-quality image of a random superhero is displayed to both players simultaneously. The hero's difficulty will be chosen based on the players' skill levels.
* **Guessing Mechanic:** Players are presented with 4 multiple-choice options to guess the correct superhero name.
* **Scoring & Round Winner:**
  * A player earns one point for winning a round.
  * If one player answers correctly and the other incorrectly, the correct player wins the round.
  * If both players answer correctly, the player who submitted their answer first wins the round.
  * If both players answer incorrectly, no one wins the round.
* **Post-Round Information:** After a round ends, the correct answer and a humorous fact about the animal superhero's powers, origin, or animal-themed abilities will be displayed to both players before the next round begins.
* **Battle End:** A battle consists of 5 rounds. The player with the most points at the end of 5 rounds is the winner.
* **Tie-Breaker:** If scores are tied after 5 rounds, a "sudden death" tie-breaker round begins. The first player to answer correctly wins the match. If both players answer incorrectly, a new tie-breaker superhero is shown until a winner is decided.
* **Results Screen:** At the end of the battle, a summary screen will show the winner, final scores, and currency earned.
