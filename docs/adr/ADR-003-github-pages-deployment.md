# ADR-003: GitHub Pages Deployment Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The DuperHeroes project requires a hosting solution that supports:
- Automated deployment from version control
- Zero or minimal hosting costs
- HTTPS support for security and modern browser requirements
- Global content delivery for performance
- Custom domain support (optional)
- Simple rollback capabilities

Project constraints include:
- Static site architecture (no server-side processing required)
- Small team with limited DevOps experience
- Preference for integrated tooling over separate services
- Need for reliable hosting with minimal maintenance overhead
- Fast deployment cycles for rapid iteration

The application consists entirely of static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON) with no backend requirements, making it suitable for static hosting solutions.

## Decision

We will use GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions for automated deployment of the DuperHeroes application.

The deployment strategy includes:
- GitHub Actions workflow triggered on pushes to the production branch
- Automated deployment from the `public/` directory to GitHub Pages
- Custom domain support via CNAME configuration
- HTTPS automatically provided by GitHub Pages
- Version control integration with automatic rollback capabilities

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Netlify Static Hosting
- **Description**: Deploy static site directly to Netlify with git integration
- **Pros**: Excellent developer experience, advanced features (form handling, redirects), global CDN, generous free tier
- **Cons**: External service dependency, potential vendor lock-in, overkill for simple static site
- **Risk Level**: Low

### Option 2: Vercel (formerly Zeit Now)
- **Description**: Deploy to Vercel platform optimized for frontend applications
- **Pros**: Excellent performance, automatic previews, edge functions available, modern platform
- **Cons**: External service dependency, complex pricing model, unnecessary features for static site
- **Risk Level**: Low

### Option 3: AWS S3 + CloudFront
- **Description**: Host static files on S3 with CloudFront CDN distribution
- **Pros**: Highly scalable, AWS ecosystem integration, fine-grained control, enterprise-grade
- **Cons**: Complex setup, AWS billing complexity, requires AWS knowledge, overkill for simple project
- **Risk Level**: High

### Option 4: Firebase Hosting
- **Description**: Deploy to Google Firebase hosting platform
- **Pros**: Google infrastructure, good performance, simple CLI deployment
- **Cons**: External service dependency, requires Google account setup, unnecessary complexity
- **Risk Level**: Medium

### Option 5: Traditional Web Hosting (Shared Hosting)
- **Description**: Upload files to traditional web hosting provider via FTP
- **Pros**: Familiar deployment process, widely available, predictable costs
- **Cons**: Manual deployment process, no automation, limited scalability, potential downtime
- **Risk Level**: Low

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero hosting costs**: GitHub Pages is free for public repositories
- **Integrated workflow**: Deployment directly connected to source control
- **Automatic HTTPS**: SSL certificates managed automatically by GitHub
- **Global CDN**: Content delivered via GitHub's global infrastructure
- **Simple rollback**: Git-based rollback to any previous version
- **Branch-based deployment**: Easy staging and production environment management
- **No external dependencies**: Everything managed within GitHub ecosystem
- **Reliable uptime**: Backed by GitHub's infrastructure SLA

### Negative
- **GitHub dependency**: Vendor lock-in to GitHub platform
- **Limited customization**: Cannot customize server configuration or add server-side features
- **Bandwidth limitations**: GitHub Pages has soft bandwidth limits (100GB/month)
- **Build time limits**: GitHub Actions has execution time limits (6 hours for free accounts)
- **Public repository requirement**: Free tier requires public repository
- **Limited redirect support**: No server-side redirects or advanced routing

### Neutral
- **Performance**: Good but not necessarily optimal compared to specialized CDNs
- **Custom domain**: Available but requires DNS configuration
- **Monitoring**: Basic uptime monitoring, no advanced analytics included

## Implementation Notes

### GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration
```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [ production ]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: './public'
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### Deployment Process
1. Developer pushes changes to production branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow automatically triggers
3. Workflow uploads `public/` directory contents to GitHub Pages
4. Site becomes available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`
5. Changes are live within 2-3 minutes of push

### Branch Strategy
- `main` branch for development and testing
- `production` branch for stable releases
- Pull requests for code review before production deployment
- Automatic deployment only from production branch

### Success Metrics
- Deployment time under 5 minutes from push to live
- 99.9% uptime (GitHub Pages SLA)
- Global availability with CDN performance
- Zero hosting costs maintained
- Successful rollback capability within 10 minutes

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Monitor GitHub Pages status via GitHub Status page
- Set up repository notifications for failed deployments
- Regular testing of deployment process and rollback procedures
- Monitor repository size and bandwidth usage
