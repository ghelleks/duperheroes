# ADR-001: Static Single-Page Application Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The DuperHeroes project is a web-based superhero identification game that needs to:
- Provide an interactive gaming experience with real-time feedback
- Support offline-capable functionality after initial load
- Minimize hosting costs and infrastructure complexity
- Enable rapid development and deployment cycles
- Ensure fast loading times for optimal user experience
- Support mobile and desktop browsers without platform-specific builds

The team consists of developers comfortable with web technologies but without extensive backend infrastructure experience. The project has constraints of minimal budget for hosting and a preference for simple deployment workflows.

## Decision

We will implement DuperHeroes as a static single-page application (SPA) with all game logic contained within a single HTML file and accompanying static assets.

The architecture consists of:
- Single `index.html` file containing all application logic
- Static JSON data file for hero database
- CSS styling via CDN-delivered framework
- Client-side JavaScript for all game mechanics and state management
- No server-side processing or dynamic backend components

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Multi-Page Static Site
- **Description**: Traditional multi-page website with separate HTML files for different game sections
- **Pros**: Simple to understand, SEO-friendly, familiar development pattern
- **Cons**: Page reloads break game flow, shared state management complex, poor user experience for timed games
- **Risk Level**: Low

### Option 2: Client-Server Architecture with Backend API
- **Description**: React/Vue frontend with Node.js/Python backend and database
- **Pros**: Scalable, supports real-time multiplayer, centralized data management, industry standard
- **Cons**: Requires hosting infrastructure, increases complexity and cost, overkill for single-player game, longer development time
- **Risk Level**: Medium

### Option 3: Progressive Web App (PWA) with Service Workers
- **Description**: SPA enhanced with PWA capabilities for offline functionality
- **Pros**: Offline support, app-like experience, performance benefits
- **Cons**: Additional complexity, browser compatibility considerations, overkill for simple game
- **Risk Level**: Medium

### Option 4: Static Site Generator (Gatsby/Next.js)
- **Description**: Build-time generated static site with modern tooling
- **Pros**: Modern development experience, optimized builds, component-based architecture
- **Cons**: Build process complexity, unnecessary for simple game, tooling overhead
- **Risk Level**: Low

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero hosting costs**: Can be deployed on GitHub Pages or any static hosting service
- **Instant loading**: All resources loaded upfront, no network requests during gameplay
- **Simple deployment**: Single file upload or git push deployment
- **Offline capability**: Game works without internet connection after initial load
- **Fast development**: No build process or complex tooling required
- **Version control friendly**: Single HTML file is easy to track and diff
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on any device with a modern web browser

### Negative
- **Scalability limitations**: Cannot support multiplayer or server-side features
- **SEO challenges**: Single-page nature limits search engine optimization
- **Initial load size**: All code and data loaded upfront regardless of usage
- **Limited analytics**: No server-side tracking capabilities
- **State persistence**: Limited to client-side storage only
- **Code organization**: All logic in single file can become unwieldy as complexity grows

### Neutral
- **Security**: No server-side attack surface, but also no server-side validation
- **Performance**: Fast once loaded, but potentially slower initial load
- **Maintenance**: Simple to maintain but harder to modularize

## Implementation Notes

- Use modern JavaScript ES6+ features for clean code organization within the single file
- Implement graceful fallbacks for data loading (embedded mock data if JSON fails to load)
- Structure code with clear separation of concerns despite single-file constraint
- Use localStorage for persisting user progress and preferences
- Optimize for mobile-first responsive design
- Include comprehensive error handling for network failures

### Success Metrics
- Page load time under 2 seconds on 3G connections
- Game functionality works completely offline after initial load
- Zero-cost hosting achieved through static deployment
- Sub-second response times for all game interactions
